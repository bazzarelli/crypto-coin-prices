### enhancements added so far:

* SWR hook for data fetching from coingecko api
* Recharts to display crypto coin chart
* Simple state management (useState, useEffect, useContext)



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Steps to run locally

First, install the packages from the project root:
```bash
npm install
```
Then, run the development server:
